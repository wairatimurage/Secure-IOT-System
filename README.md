Secure IoT Device Management System

The Secure IoT Device Management System is a comprehensive solution for securely managing and monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in an enterprise environment. It provides authentication, encryption, remote management, monitoring/logging, security compliance, and resilience features to ensure the security and integrity of IoT devices and the data they generate.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure device authentication using client-side certificates and role-based access control (RBAC) for granular access control.
  
- **Encryption**: Data encryption both in transit and at rest using AES encryption to prevent unauthorized access and eavesdropping.
  
- **Device Lifecycle Management**: Provisioning and decommissioning of devices with robust inventory management capabilities.
  
- **Remote Device Management**: Remote configuration, firmware updates, and troubleshooting of devices.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Logging of device activity, network traffic, and security events for auditing and analysis.
  
- **Security Compliance**: Conduct security audits, remediate vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with industry-specific security standards and regulations.
  
- **Resilience and Failover**: Implement failover mechanisms and high availability features for uninterrupted device management.
